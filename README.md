# Built Netflix clone using ReactJS (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase, Compound & Styled Components
[Demo](https://netflix-clone-88c67.web.app/)

This application (Netflix clone) is built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Styled Components. Built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage. You can create account using sign up and sign in with same credentials. User can browse Series and Films. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well. I have deployed this application on firebase.
